GES1017 Waste Management in Singapore

1. Why is waste management such a concern in Singapore?
Health concerns, land constraints, environmental awareness


2. How would you measure the performance of a waste management system? How does Singapore fare?
Compare ourselves with countries that are doing well
Currently not doing very well


3. What is the role of engineers in creating Semakau Landfill? (or waste management in Singapore)
Design and plan the island (environmental impact of leeching into the sea, the flow and capacity of the island's operations) 
Construct the area on water
Transplant the mangroves
Reduce the waste going into the landfill
Optimize transportation routes
Cost/benefit analysis; cost efficiency
Reuse the ash and other wastes (eg build buildings)


4. Do you think that efforts to make Singaporeans recycle have been successful? If not, how can it be improved?
Regulate households (taxation)
Incentives to recycle
Start initiates (maybe start at workplaces, easier to implement)


5. Should Singapore consider transporting waste overseas? What are the benefits and challenges?
Political issues
Security issues (they can lock us out of their country)
We could build an incineration plant in other countries (mutual benefit: solve their trash dumping and solve our land issues)



6. What are the waste management challenges that Singapore would face in the future?
Given your training in NUS, how do you suggest that these challenges be overcome?
Finite space in Semakau
Consider the waste impact before new materials are synthesized
Fine individuals who produce much trash (hard to enforce)
